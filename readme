LegacySPC is a C++ library that implements the 8bit Sony SPC700 CPU and its DSP core.
This processor was used in the Super Nintendo as a coprocessor for audio and music.

I'm developing this project as a learning experience about CPU emulation and DSP implementation. The goal is to have clean and understandable code, efficiently is a nice to have :)
